# Chatbot-BIT-AI-LAB
Designed Chatbot for Artificial intelligence laboratory at Bannari Amman Institute of Technology.

## ABSTRACT

* Chat-Bot based on information retrieval is focused on processing user
query by using a text document file.

* The complexity of natural language will make it very difficult to access
the information in the text.

* Therefore, Natural Language processing is used to solve the problem,
e.g. Google assistant, Alexa.

* This project provide knowledge about the institution and mainly useful
for students, parents, faculties and any external users to ask queries and
also it is helpful to know the college details without any physical
contact.

* Text to speech conversion provides a better way of interaction with the
user. User can go either for text based information retrieval or voice
based retrieval. The text based and voice based retrieval output is based
on keywords used. NLTK uses tokenization, steaming and
Lemmatization of keywords, by matching them with the document

## TYPES OF BOT
* Rule Based Chatbots: Answers questions based on some rules. Fails to
manage complex ones

* Self Learning bots: Uses Machine Learning based approaches

* Retrieval Based Methods: Apply some logic to select a reply from
library of predefined responses

* Generative Bots: Generate the answers and they not reply with one
from set of answers.
